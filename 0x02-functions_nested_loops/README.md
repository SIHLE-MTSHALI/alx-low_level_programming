# C Programming Project

This is a collection of various C files each performing unique tasks:

1. `0-putchar.c` : This program prints "_putchar", followed by a new line.
2. `1-alphabet.c` : A function that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
3. `2-print_alphabet_x10.c` : A function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
4. `3-islower.c` : A function that checks for lowercase character. Returns 1 if the character is lowercase, 0 otherwise.
5. `4-isalpha.c` : A function that checks for alphabetic character. Returns 1 if the character is a letter, 0 otherwise.
6. `5-sign.c` : A function that prints the sign of a number. Returns 1 and prints + if the number is greater than zero, 0 and prints 0 if the number is zero, -1 and prints - if the number is less than zero.
7. `6-abs.c` : A function that computes the absolute value of an integer.
8. `7-print_last_digit.c` : A function that prints the last digit of a number and returns the value of the last digit.
9. `8-24_hours.c` : A function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.
10. `9-times_table.c` : A function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.
11. `10-add.c` : A function that adds two integers and returns the result.
12. `11-print_to_98.c` : A function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line.
13. `100-times_table.c` : A function that prints the n times table, starting with 0.
14. `101-natural.c` : A program that lists all the natural numbers below 1024 (excluded) that are multiples of 3 or 5.
15. `102-fibonacci.c` : A program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, separated by a comma followed by a space.
16. `103-fibonacci.c` : A program that finds and prints the sum of the even-valued Fibonacci terms.
17. `104-fibonacci.c` : A program that prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers.
18. `_putchar.c` : A function that writes the character c to stdout.
19. `main.h` : A header file containing the prototype of all functions used in this project.
