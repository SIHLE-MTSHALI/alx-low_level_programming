# alx-low_level_programming

This repository contains a collection of C programs that serve as exercises in understanding pointers, arrays and strings in C language. These programs are a part of the foundational curriculum for the ALX School software engineering track. Each file contains a specific C program.

## File Descriptions

### `main.h`

This is the header file containing the prototypes of all functions used in this project.

### `0-reset_to_98.c`

A function that takes a pointer to an int as a parameter and updates the value it points to 98.

### `1-swap.c`

A function that swaps the values of two integers.

### `2-strlen.c`

A function that returns the length of a string.

### `3-puts.c`

A function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.

### `4-print_rev.c`

A function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.

### `5-rev_string.c`

A function that reverses a string in place.

### `6-puts2.c`

A function that prints one char out of 2 of a string.

### `7-puts_half.c`

A function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.

### `8-print_array.c`

A function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.

### `9-strcpy.c`

A function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.

### `100-atoi.c`

A function that convert a string to an integer.

### `101-keygen.c`

A program that generates random valid passwords for the program 101-crackme.

## General Summary

These programs explore various aspects of pointers, arrays and strings in the C programming language. They encompass a broad range of functions, from simple tasks like printing a string or swapping the values of two integers, to more complex operations like copying strings, reversing strings and generating random passwords.
