# C Programming Tasks

This project includes a collection of small C programs. Each of these programs illustrates a unique aspect of the C language, such as functions, variable types, and operator usage.

## Files & Descriptions:

- `main.h`: Header file containing function prototypes.

- `_putchar.c`: Contains the definition of a function that writes a character to stdout.

- `0-isupper.c`: Contains a function that checks for uppercase letters.

- `0-main.c`: Main file for testing the `_isupper` function.

- `1-isdigit.c`: Contains a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).

- `1-main.c`: Main file for testing the `_isdigit` function.

- `2-mul.c`: Contains a function that multiplies two integers.

- `2-main.c`: Main file for testing the `mul` function.

- `3-print_numbers.c`: Contains a function that prints the numbers from `0` to `9`.

- `3-main.c`: Main file for testing the `print_numbers` function.

- `4-print_most_numbers.c`: Contains a function that prints numbers from `0` to `9`, excluding `2` and `4`.

- `4-main.c`: Main file for testing the `print_most_numbers` function.

- `5-more_numbers.c`: Contains a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from `0` to `14`.

- `5-main.c`: Main file for testing the `more_numbers` function.

- `6-print_line.c`: Contains a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.

- `6-main.c`: Main file for testing the `print_line` function.

- `7-print_diagonal.c`: Contains a function that draws a diagonal line in the terminal.

- `7-main.c`: Main file for testing the `print_diagonal` function.

- `8-print_square.c`: Contains a function that prints a square.

- `8-main.c`: Main file for testing the `print_square` function.

- `9-fizz_buzz.c`: Contains a program that prints the numbers from `1` to `100`, but for multiples of `3`, print `Fizz` instead of the number and for multiples of `5`, print `Buzz`.

- `10-print_triangle.c`: Contains a function that prints a triangle.

- `10-main.c`: Main file for testing the `print_triangle` function.

- `100-prime_factor.c`: Contains a program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number `612852475143`.

- `101-print_number.c`: Contains a function that prints an integer.

- `101-main.c`: Main file for testing the `print_number` function.

The functions implemented in this project aim to illustrate the core elements of programming in C. The tasks present in the project range from simple tasks like printing a string of numbers, to more complex tasks, such as identifying prime numbers. Overall, the project serves as a comprehensive practice of basic C programming concepts.
